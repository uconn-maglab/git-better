## My guinea pigs are really better at organic chemistry than i am


### This is Zoe. She's really better than I am at organic chemistry and she likes to practice drawing reactions in her free time and stuff:

### This is Zuka. She also likes to chemistry and hates herself. You get two photos of her because she's mostly hidden (because she's doing chemistry probably):

### This is Marcie, short for Marceline but unofficially short for Toasted Marshmallow. She likes exploring more than snuggling. That's my boyfriend Mike holding her. He's also cute:
